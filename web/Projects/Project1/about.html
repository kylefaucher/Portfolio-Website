			what is the war on drugs?
		</h1>

		<p class = "aboutp">
			In 1971, president Richard Nixon first declared the so called "War on Drugs." It was claimed to be declared in an attempt to control the damaging effects of drugs on society. Years later, president Ronald Reagan greatly expanded this war on drugs. Incarceration rates for nonviolent drug crimes began to skyrocket. Countless campaigns were launched to stigmatize drug use and demonize those that used and sold drugs. Still today, billions of dollars are spent annually by the government to incarcerate those who use and sell illicit drugs.

			why is this an issue?
		</h1>

		<p class = "aboutp">
			It may seem that the War on Drugs should have a very positive effect on society and the safety of the American people, but that is not necessarily the case. Since the start, the War on Drugs has always had a focus of targeting those who are black or latino. <br> <br> For example, historically, much harsher mandatory minimum sentences have been set for crack cocaine when compared to powder cocaine. Though they are essentially the same chemical, crack cocaine is most often associated with lower income populations and people of color, while powder cocaine is usually associated with the upper class and white individuals. This has resulted in those using crack cocaine having sentences 100 times longer than those sentences for powder cocaine. This is only one example of the war on drugs specifically targeting people of color. <br><br> Our current system of drug related incarceration has often drawn parallels and comparisons to Jim Crow era oppression, has even been labeled "The New Jim Crow." Though change is being made (such as an act signed in 2010 to lower the ratio of crack to powder cocaine sentencing from 100:1 to 18:1), these issues are deeply engrained. The issue has affected the families of millions of people of color, and ruined many people's lives with excessive sentencing. Many have proposed the idea of treating drug-related issues as a mental health matter rather than a criminal one.

			Educating yourself on the issue and its implications is a great start to making a difference. Further action, however, is required for us as a society to move past this oppressive and systematically discriminatory legal system. By clicking the link at the bottom of this page, you can begin to make a change, whether that be by contacting your government representatives, or taking part in campaigns.
