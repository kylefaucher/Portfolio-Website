		<h3> What is a <em>Kardashian</em> vs a <em>Jenner?</em> </h3>
		<p> "Kardashian" is often an umbrella term used to describe any member of the Kardashian-Jenner joint family. More accurately, however, the Jenner family includes Caitlyn Jenner, and those children shared by her and Kris Jenner (Kendall and Kylie). True Kardashians are the children shared by Kris Jenner and Rob Kardashian (ie. Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, and Rob). </p>
